* DESCRIPTION AND INSTALL *
***************************
This project uses the League of Legends API to query current games as well as
get a summoners match history, level, and rank. This is helpful for any player
getting ready to play because they now know who they are playing with and 
what to expect from that player. To install this project on your local machine you 
will need some type of php server. However for convience so you
dont have to set that up I have set it up live at 
http://www.swinny.me/projects/LOL so it is easy to test and access.

**************
* HOW TO USE *
**************
To use this project you must first some stuff about League of Legends. First
all players in the game are called summoners and there are 3 game modes 5v5, 3v3,
and ARAM (All Random All Mid). A summoner can play any one of these 3 modes and
each mode is accompined by different spell sets and item sets. To make this simple
when you hit the webpage you will see some games listed that are 5v5. You should
see a total of 5 games in total as they scroll by at a rate of 1 game every 5
seconds. To query any one of the games simply click on a summoners name listed.
The site will they query either their summoner info or the current game they are
in depending on which radio button you have checked. You can also type in a
summoner name manually in order to query a specific game that is live.

*********************
* WHAT IS DISPLAYED *
*********************
Each one of two options displays different things about a summoner and their
game(s). The current game option will display generic info about that specific game 
from all 10 summoners includeing, their summoner name, the champion name and image
for the champion, the spells the summoner took for the game, and the summoners 
level and rank. However if you use the summoner info option it will display the
summoners level and rank as well as the rank image. It will also display the past
10 games as well as the number of kills, deaths, assists, wards placed, gold
earned, minions killed, items bought, spells taken, and champion taken for each
of the 10 games. This is useful for summoners to know how they or their enemy
have preformed in the past 10 games they have played.

***************
* EASTER EGGS *
***************
Try querying the name telekineticblub (this is me) in summoner info the rank is 
intresting :D this rank happens for any unranked player because i could not come
up with a good way to show a player was unranked.
